### How to use this map
If you're a California public radio newsroom and wish to publish this map on your site you have a few options:

* Point users to the full-spread version hosted by CapRadio here: https://projects.capradio.org/california-wildfire-map/
* Host this map yourself on your own servers by cloning this repository.
* Use [pym.js](http://blog.apps.npr.org/pym.js/) or an [iframe](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_responsive_iframes.asp) to embed the map on your site or within an article.

#### Customizing the map to fit your coverage area or a specific fire

1. Navigate to https://projects.capradio.org/california-wildfire-map/ 
2. Click, drag, scroll and zoom on the map until you're focused on the area you'd like to highlight.
3. You'll notice the URL changes as you pan and zoom around the map. It looks something like https://projects.capradio.org/california-wildfire-map/#5.5/37.695/-122.914.) In order, the three numbers correspond to: Zoom level (lower numbers mean wider view), latitude, and longitude.
4. Copy the URL when you've positioned the map where you want it.
5. Use that URL in your pym or iframe embed.
